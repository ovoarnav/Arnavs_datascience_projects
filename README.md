Decision Tree Classifier for Creator Prediction
This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether an individual is a "creator" based on demographic and behavioral features. The dataset includes information such as ethnicity, gender, and other attributes, and the target variable (yes creator) indicates whether the person is a creator.

Features
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier from scikit-learn for binary classification.
Dynamic Model Updates: Add new data points dynamically and retrain the model without restarting the pipeline.
Performance Evaluation:
Displays model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Includes a confusion matrix visualization using matplotlib and seaborn.
Train-Test Split: Ensures robust evaluation by splitting the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.
Functionality
Train the Decision Tree Classifier on an initial dataset.
Dynamically add new data and retrain the model.
Evaluate the model's performance with metrics and visualizations.
Key Libraries
Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning model and evaluation metrics.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization tools for confusion matrices.
Python: End-to-end implementation of the machine learning pipeline.
How to Use
Clone the repository and ensure required libraries are installed.
Run the script to train the model and evaluate its performance.
Add new data dynamically using the update_model function.
Visualization
Includes visual representations of the confusion matrix and classification metrics for easy interpretation of the model's performance.
