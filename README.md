# Arnavs_datascience_projects

A project I created using python, to analyse stock data

This project was based on two stocks Nifty and Sipla.

Based on the condition, If nifty current > nifty previous day buy Sipla stock and If nifty current < nifty previous sell sipla stock. I had to compute weather this exacange based on 6 months of stock data would be profitable and if the total profit made / total loss was greater than 3
